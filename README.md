SpaceTrader
===========

Implementation of Space Trader for CS 2340.

This project was created by myself and 3 other teammates. The UI is simplistic and the actual gameplay is not particularly fun, but the app itself functions quite well and supports a variety of features,
such as a randomized universe, ship customization, extra crew members who can be hired as mercenaries, and a combat mini-game for encounters with pirates and police officers.

To build the project you will need Java installed (preferably a fairly recent version) as well as the Gradle build system. To build the project simply run 'gradle build' from the command line.
Currently the build process may emit a few warnings about the use of a deprecated audio API due to changes to Java since this app was created.
